The Second Chance Employer Database allows returning citizens (formerly incarcerated people) to search for jobs that do not list old felony or misdemeanor convictions as disqualifiers for application. The tool is a pilot project for a collection of non-profits in the DC, VA, MD area to use with existing cohorts of women returning from prison and looking for employment.
