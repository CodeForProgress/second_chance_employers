Second Chance Employer Database: User Stories
=============================================

(1) As a returning citizen applying to a job, I want to be able to quickly look up an employer's RC-friendliness score and profile so that I know if this employer is worth applying to.

(2) As a returning citizen who just had a job interview with an employer, I want to be able to record my experience with that employer so that I can let others know whether or not I was treated fairly or hired.

(3) As an employer who is taking steps to become more returning citizen friendly, I want to be able to self-report information about my practices so that I can let consumers and job seekers know that I share their values and want to do business with them.

(4) As a social worker or city employee in DC looking to find out if I need to investigate an employer's compliance with the new Ban the Box legislation, I want to be able to quickly search for an employer's profile so that I can see how they have been flagged or reported for their practices by jobseekers.

(5) As a consumer who cares about reducing incarceration, I want to quickly search for the best businesses in a category of service or product so that I can spend my dollars at an establishment that shares my values.
